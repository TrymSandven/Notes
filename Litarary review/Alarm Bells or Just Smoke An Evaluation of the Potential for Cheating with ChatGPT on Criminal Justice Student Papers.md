Alarm Bells or Just Smoke: An Evaluation of the Potential for Cheating with ChatGPT on Criminal Justice Student Papers
========================
Writetn by Timothy A Engle and Jospeh L. Nedelec

### OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT is an advanced large language model AI that has caused both excitement and concern in academia. TurnItIn and similar software programs are widely used in higher education to detect potential plagiarism. However, the extent to which such software can identify papers produced by ChatGPT remains unclear. The current study partially addressed this question by submitting five versions of short essays about criminological topics generated
from ChatGPT to the TurnItIn software. Overall, the results indi-
cated that TurnItIn adequately detected that the essays were not
original works (mean percent plagiarized score = 31%). The analy-
ses further illustrated that ChatGPT wrote at an exceedingly high
level (mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 15.1) atypical of essays in
higher education. Consequently, it appears that detection of
AI-generated writing may be easier than initially assumed although
the technology is bound to improve. Accordingly, possible strate-
gies for approaching AI in higher education are proposed.
