Alarm Bells or Just Smoke: An Evaluation of the Potential for Cheating with ChatGPT on Criminal Justice Student Papers
========================
Writetn by Timothy A Engle and Jospeh L. Nedelec

### OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT is an advanced large language model AI that has caused both excitement and concern in academia. TurnItIn and similar software programs are widely used in higher education to detect potential plagiarism. However, the extent to which such software can identify papers produced by ChatGPT remains unclear. The current study partially addressed this question by submitting five versions of short essays about criminological topics generated from ChatGPT to the TurnItIn software. Overall, the results indi- cated that TurnItIn adequately detected that the essays were not original works (mean percent plagiarized score = 31%). The analy- ses further illustrated that ChatGPT wrote at an exceedingly high level (mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 15.1) atypical of essays in higher education. Consequently, it appears that detection of AI-generated writing may be easier than initially assumed although the technology is bound to improve. Accordingly, possible strategies for approaching AI in higher education are proposed.

## Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a validated formula used to assess the reading comprehension difficulty of a given text (Flesch, 1948; Hoke, 1999; Dufty et al., 2006; Hensel, 2014; Roberts et al., 2016). The Flesch-Kincaid formula was originally developed for use within the United States Navy for the purposes of ensuring that training manuals would be easy for personnel to read (Flesch, 1948). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula is a variation of the original formula proposed by Flesch in 1948 which is designed for scores to reflect the number of years of education an individual has had since age 6 (Flesch, 1948; Hensel, 2014). A score of six for example, would rep-
resent that to comprehend the given text, someone would need six years of education. The full formula is relatively straightforward to calculate: $Flesch \ Kincaid \ Grade \ Level= {Total \ number \ of \ words \over Total \ number \ of \ sentences} + {Total \ number \ of \ syllebals \over Total \ number \ of \ words} -15.5$

## Methods
The methods section has a good way of talking about what prompts has been used

## Result
Turnitin gave a score of about 30% on all the texts.
